Most text files in this repository contain a conspicuous notice
stating the license and copyright that it is provided under. All files
that do not contain such a notice have the same information listed in
the "LEGAL" file instead.

The phrases "GPL 2.0" and "GPL 2.0 only" are used to indicate that a
file is licensed ONLY under version two of the "GNU General Public
License" (as published by the Free Software Foundation). In
particular, GPL version 3 has no bearing on how these files are
allowed to be used.

The lack of an explicit declaration of license or copyright for any
file is a mistake and should be reported as a bug so that it can be
fixed. In the unlikely event that such a mistake does exist, one
cannot assume that such files are provided under the same license as
the rest of the repository; they might not even be under an open
source license at all.
